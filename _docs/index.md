## Why PivotPHP?

PivotPHP brings the simplicity and elegance of Express.js to the PHP ecosystem while maintaining the performance and reliability PHP developers expect. With impressive API throughput (up to 70.9 million requests/hour), zero configuration requirements, and PSR-15 compliance, PivotPHP is perfect for:

- Local API development and testing
- Concept validation and prototyping
- Learning modern PHP patterns
- Building proof-of-concept applications

## Key Features

### üöÄ High-Performance APIs
With competitive API performance, PivotPHP delivers solid speed for real-world applications. Our latest cross-framework benchmarks show:

- **ReactPHP Runtime**: 1.97M operations/sec specialized for async
- **ORM Variant**: 458K operations/sec optimized for database operations
- **vs Slim 4**: Competitive positioning (12.5% performance gap)

*Benchmarks run in standardized Docker containers to ensure fair and reproducible testing conditions across all framework variants.*

### üõ°Ô∏è Security First
Built-in security features including CSRF protection, XSS prevention, rate limiting, and secure authentication make your applications safe by default.

### üîß Zero Configuration
Start building immediately with sensible defaults. No complex configuration files or setup required - just install and code.
